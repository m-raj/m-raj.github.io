I am Mayank Raj. I am a PhD student in the department of Applied + Computational Mathematics at Caltech. I am co-advised by [Professor Kaushik Bhattacharya](https://mechmat.caltech.edu/) and [Professor Andrew Stuart](http://stuart.caltech.edu/). The first year of my graduate study is funded by the Bell Family Graduate Fellowship. 

While I have a varied interests, I am currently working on multiscale modelling of materials where the material properties at fine length and time scales are homogenized to get macrosopic response to load. 

I received B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering and M.Tech. in Data Science with minor in Mathematics from IIT Madras in 2021. Upon graduation, I worked for an year as a data scientist at Wells Fargo.
