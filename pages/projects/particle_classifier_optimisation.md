 The closed spiral classifier (CSC) is a novel enhanced gravity particle classifier. The particle-laden fluid stream is allowed to pass through a helical non-circular channel. Because of induced centrifugal forces, the particles with a higher effective mass move towards the outer periphery of the channel. The strength of the particle movement (separation efficiency) depends on various design parameters (inner radius of curvature, pitch, aspect ratio, outlet splitter position) and process conditions (inlet flow velocity, particles density, loading, viscosity) of the classifier. The objective of this work is to develop a mathematical model to optimize the design of the classifier. Deployed the machine learning (ML) models to predict the best design and process parameters that should be used to maximize the efficiency of particle classification. ML models are trained on the data generated by high-fidelity CFD simulations. Leveraged by the helical design of the separator in data generation, each CFD model is used to proxy several simulations conditions, such as the exit cut-point location and the number of turns of the separator. The ML models search the design space and generate the Pareto fronts for trading-off objective functions. The models substitute the CFD simulations, decreasing the computational time of the optimization process. A selected set of attractive optimized conditions were validated successfully through CFD simulations. The work is anticipated to be a starting point for developing hybrid optimization algorithms using ML along with innovative search methods like genetic algorithms.

**Design variables:**
The table below shows various design variables and corresponding ranges considered in the optimization task. The histograms on the right side show the min-max normalized distribution of different variables
used to generate a dataset for training ML models.

**Results:**
Two machine learning models on the CFD-generated dataset are trained to predict the separation factor and the corresponding
pressure drop. The gradient boosting regression model was used to predict separation factors as a function of several design variables, while a simple learning regression model was used to predict the pressure drop. The accuracy of the gradient boosting
model used to predict separation factor is shown in comparison plots in the figure below:

Moreover, the parity plot between the actual and the predicted variable is shown in the figure below. The plot on the left 
shows comparsion between the seperation factor values obtained using CFD simulation and the ML model, whereas the plot
on right shows comparsion between the pressure drop per turn of the helix of particle classifier:

**Result of optimisation task:**

High separation factor or efficiency is often achieved at the cost of high-pressure drop result in high operating costs of the particle classifier. Hence, multi-objective
optimization is needed to maximize separation efficiency and minimize pressure drop. The trained machine learning
models explore the design space and obtain a Pareto front between the trading-off objective functions. The Pareto-optimal 
points can be observed in the figure shown below. Three points were selected at the Pareto front to validate their
separation efficiency with CFD simulation.

Another interesting optimization task is to maximize the sharpness of a separation factor curve while ensuring a certain level of separation factor is achieved for a particular particle diameter.
D70 is defined as the diameter of particles for which a separation factor close to 70% is achieved. The plot on the left in the figure below shows
the distribution of D70 and the slope of the separation factor curve at the corresponding point. Ideally, one would maximize the
slope often referred to as the sharpness of the separation factor curve. By observing the highlighted points in the plots below,
one can observe that sharpness of the separation factor curve increases at higher pressure drops.
