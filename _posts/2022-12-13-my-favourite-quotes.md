While watching movies and going through articles now and then, I come across quotes, dialogues and lines that leave me inspired. The movie or article from which a quote is taken from gives the necessary context to appreciate it, which may not be equally inspiring without the context.

- Success is not final, failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts. - Winston Churchill. "Darkest Hour"
- Ford vs Ferrari, Ken Miles is talking to his son about perfect lap. Ken Mile's Son: You can't make every lap perfect. Ken Miles: But I can try.
